# Getting Started

Note: Project uses cmake instead of the default generated projucer project.

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `juceq` folder.

2. Open the project in CLion (highly recommended), the cmake files will clone the juce framework and setup the whole project automagically.

3. Alternatively using visual studio code, install C/C++, CMake and CMakeTools extensions, then build.
